            Continents

        <h3>
            A continent is any of several large geographical regions. 
            Continents are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria. 
            A continent could be a single landmass or a part of a very large landmass, as in the case of Asia or Europe.
            Due to this, the number of continents varies; up to seven or as few as four geographical regions are commonly regarded as continents. 
            Most English-speaking countries recognize seven regions as continents. 
            In order from largest to smallest in area, these seven regions are Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia.
