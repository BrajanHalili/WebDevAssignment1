    <h1> Earth </h1>
    <p> 
        Earth, our blue oasis in the vast expanse of space, is a remarkable and unique planet.
        It is the only known celestial body that supports life as we know it. 
        With its diverse ecosystems, abundant resources, and breathtaking landscapes, Earth is a haven for all forms of life.
        From the towering peaks of the Himalayas to the depths of the Mariana Trench, Earth showcases its extraordinary range of landscapes. 
        Vast oceans cover most of its surface, teeming with life, while lush forests, expansive deserts, and fertile plains dot the continents.
